# README — Ukraine Map Project

### 1. Project Overview
This is may project<br>
https://akiha1224.github.io/Ukraine_Map/<br>

This map was created as part of an assignment for The Lede Program.
The goal was to strengthen our technical skills in QGIS and Adobe Illustrator while practicing map design and visual communication.

### 2. References and Inspiration

I referred to the materials distributed as part of the assignment, as well as a map published by *The New York Times* for inspiration and design reference.

### 3. Workflow

I used QGIS to load and process spatial data and to create initial labels.
Final styling was done in Adobe Illustrator, including adjustments to labels, color palette, legend design, and visual hierarchy.

### 4. Challenges and Lessons Learned

One of the most difficult parts was isolating and coloring only the roads within Ukraine. I initially applied the color as a **fill** instead of a **stroke**, which caused multiple reworks.

I also realized, during Illustrator editing, that several important layers or details had been left out during the QGIS stage. This taught me the importance of carefully reviewing what data is needed *before* exporting from QGIS.

While I was able to match the overall style and color scheme of the reference map, I struggled to recreate the striped fill used for Crimea. The color and line thickness didn’t perfectly match the original, and I’m still unsure what the best approach would have been.
